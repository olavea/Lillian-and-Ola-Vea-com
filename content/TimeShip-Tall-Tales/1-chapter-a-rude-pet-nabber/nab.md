Hi! My name is Lance-Lotta, or "Lot"
That's my friend Lizzie. We like ice crime.

Yeah! You read that right, ice CRIME. REALLY cold cases. Like in ancient homicide. We're dev-tech-ties, we use React JS to solve for example roman times murder.
But our ice crimes are secrets. So tell people we like ice cream, it's true. Look

We live on a bridge. A house on a bridge? Ain't that weird?
You might say. I assure you, capital letters weird with a pink skull dotting the «i» is just a start ....

So let's get started, shall we?

A long time ago, on a bridge far, far out ....

Twerlin's TimeShip



Two half sister, both alike in React skills on London's bustling Bridge, where we lay our scene. Will ancient homicide bring new mutiny? Back when royal blood made royal hands unclean. Will cold evidence bury two sister's strife? Or will one sister bury the other? And why is react programming practice illegal?

London Bridge is bustling with merriment in the sunshine. But two friends cannot leave their house arrest. They're singing so don't you feel sorry for them.

«Sunny shiny and I feel okaaay
Because I'm with you todaaay»

Lizzie and Lance-Lotta are playing with their beloved pet rodents Milly and Tilly. Milly and Tilly loves finding their way through the maze of tunnels the girls are programming for them.

(maze of orange)

Lance-Lotta pretends Tilly is a swashbukling pirate captain leading her crew in a hunt for their enemy's hidden treasure trove.

«Oi! Lizzie! Did you hear THAT?» Says Lance-Lotta

«Hear what?» Says Lizzie

«A crash downstairs.» Says Lance-Lotta

«No, that crash was surely out in the street.» Says Lizzie

«Let's hide.» Says Lance-Lotta

«No, I want to play.» Says Lizzie

«Let's hide just in case. Uncle Kay will yell at us if we don't.» Says Lance-Lotta

«Okay, okay.» Says Lizzie

They hide in the secret room under the treaure chest. And wouldn't you know it, seconds later their bedroom door creaks open. They hear Milly and Tilly's panicked squeeks, the bedroom door slams shut. Lance-Lotta is outta the secret room grabbing her sturdy wood cutlass and on her way towards the stairs with Lizzie right behind her. An unfamiliar deep voice from downstairs says:

«My, my, my breaking into my home in broad daylight. How rude.» Says a deep unfamiliar voice.

«Step away from the doorway fatboy or else....» Says a drawling voice.

«Put my pets down and I'll let you out without broken bones.» Says the unfamiliar deep voice.

Lizzie and Lance-Lotta are racing down the stairs.

«You don't live here fatboy. These pets are mine.» Says the drawling voice.

«Wait!» Shouts Lizzie, but too late. Lance-Lotta's sturdy wood cutlass loudly hits the hand holding the cage with Milly and Tilly inside

«Smack!»

A hooked dagger swings towards Lance-Lotta's face.
(dagger)

«Crack!» Lizzie's wood cutlass sends the hooked dagger flying. The tall, thin black-masked man miracoulously holds two hooked daggers.

«Click» goes the sound of a fire-arm being cocked. «Eaaasy! Take it eaaaasy ladies. And you black-mask I WANT to put holes in you, so go ahead punk make my day.» Says the compact hooded figure while stepping aside from the open doorway.

«You'll regret this. All of you. You have no idea who you've ...GAH!» Says the drawling voice. The black-masked man stumbles out the door after a loud crack on the butt from Lizzie's wood cutlass.

«You tell your Coward-in-Chief to come talk to my face and NOT send minions.» Says Lizzie.

«Oh I will. Don't worry I will. Ha-HaHa-Ha!» The wild laughter disappears up the street along with the tall, thin black-masked man.

«THAT young ladies was RASH. No doubt you'll regret that dearly and soon. Black-mask would not be here if not under orders from a bad, bad and dangerously powerful person. You wouldn't already have a quarrel with a dangerously dictatorial person, would you?» Says hood-man lowering his hood.

«You COULD say that....» Says Lizzie

«Hey! have you ever seen a hooked dagger like THIS. I'm Lance-Lotta and who may you be? Mysterious mystery man?» Says Lance-Lotta holding up the hooked dagger.

«A pleasure to finally meet you two. I'm Twerlin.» Says Twerlin.

«Hello there Twerlin and welcome to our home.» Says Lizzie.

«Thanks, but I'm not staying long and neither are you. You're coming with me to Hook's Town or your going to end up in a cell in the Tower soon.» Says Twerlin.

«Hold your Horses cowboy. We're not going anywhere with you. We got work to do here. A crime to solve. And Hook's Town? Never heard of the place, sounds dangerous to.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Okay....» Says Twerlin.

«Running away now will make us look guilty of something. AND we will get into trouble if we escape our house arrest.» Says Lizzie.

«I'll tell you just what crime you'll be accused of, treasonous React programming practice with those tunnels your programming for your pet rodents. You KNOW the Queen has her Royal React Practice Monopoly» Says Twerlin.

«Nobody knows about our programming, do they ....» Says Lizzie.

«So why would THEY try to kidnap your pet rodents? Hm ....» Says Twerlin.

«DANG! Drat! Dagnabbit! Let's destroy the darn React programming evidence.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«What makes you think Black-mask didn't recover evidence? Hm .... You think he came around to drink tea?» Says Twerlin.

«Darnation! Dash! Doggone it! Let's go get that black-masked maggot!» Says Lance-Lotta jogging out the door.

«Wait Lotta! Butter my BUTT and call me a biscuit. We're wrecked! Unless we outsmart ....» Says Lizzie.

«NOW your talking, outsmarting I like the sound of that.» Says Twerlin.

«Silence! I'm thinking.» Says Lance-Lotta.
