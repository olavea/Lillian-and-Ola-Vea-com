Your code quality is linked to your beliefs, because your dev-skill building success is linked to your beliefs.

## Two Useful Beliefs you can welcome aboard Your Skill-Builder-Ship

If you want successful Skill-Building you can add some Useful Beliefs. Useful Beliefs like for example "the growth mindset" will help your skill-building. Un-Useful Beliefs like "the fixed mindset" can wreck your skill-builder-ship.

Two Useful Beliefs I have welcomed aboard my skill-builder-ship are:
1. "the growth mindset"
2. "Skill-Builder-Ship is necessary for many devs if they are to live a worthwhile dev-life"

1. "the growth mindset"
Forget talent, or the lack of talent. Your attitude to your skill-building is what MATTERS. Edit your internal monologue in a mindful way. For example if a dev-task is hard to do the phrase "this is hard, I'm no good at it" will strengthen "a fixed mindset". "The fixed mindset" can wreck your skill-builder-ship or just slow your progress. Saying "this is hard, I'm no good at it YET" will help you strengthen "a growth mindset". "the growth mindset" will help your skill-building

2. "Skill-Builder-Ship is necessary for many devs if they are to live a worthwhile dev-life"

This Useful Belief is the reason I can justify devoting my life to the study of my art. I believe that coding can act as the hook that fishes devs out of low-skill lives and into their skill-building best selves. I've seen it happen and it makes the the hard times worthwhile.
