Your beliefs matter to your code quality, because your dev-skill building success depends on your beliefs usefullness.

## Two Useful Beliefs you can welcome aboard Your Skill-Builder-Ship

If you want successful skill-building you can add some useful beliefs. Useful beliefs like for example "the growth mindset" will help your skill-building. Un-Useful Beliefs like "the fixed mindset" can wreck your skill-builder-ship.

Two useful beliefs I have welcomed aboard my skill-builder-ship:

1. "The growth mindset"
2. "Skill-builder-ship is necessary for many devs to live a worthwhile dev-life"

### 1. "the growth mindset"

Forget talent, or the lack of talent. Your attitude to your skill-building matters more. Edit your internal monologue in a mindful way. For example when doing a dev-task the phrase "this is hard, I'm no good at it" will strengthen "a fixed mindset". "The fixed mindset" can wreck your skill-builder-ship or just slow your progress. Saying "this is hard, I'm no good at it YET" will help you strengthen "a growth mindset". "The growth mindset" will help your skill-building. More about this in Carol Dweck's book ....

### 2. "Skill-Builder-Ship is necessary for many devs to live a worthwhile dev-life"

This useful belief is the reason I can justify devoting my life to the study of my art. I believe that coding can act as the hook that fishes devs out of low-skill lives and into their skill-building best selves. I've seen it happen and it makes  the hard times worthwhile.
