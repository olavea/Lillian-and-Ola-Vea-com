Transform your video TODO list from monstrous to manageable

## Are You Wasting Hours on Video Tasks?

You feel like you’re on a hamster wheel. Your Dev-Rel team is working harder than ever, but the video tasks just keep piling up. Hours spent on your video tasks are crowding out dear dev-rel time.

## Imagine Saving Hours on Video Tasks

Imagine this – Imagine feeling delighted with being off the hamster wheel. Imagine your team doing less video tasks and more dev-rel tasks.

## Let US do YOUR Video Tasks

Save time – Put some video tasks on our TODO list and delete those video tasks from your TODO list. We can for example use your dev-rel team as talent in your videos.

### Why?
Our team has been producing videos for clients for more than 2 decades
Our devs have more than 3 decades experience


### Here’s How It Works:
Our  _ _ _ _   session will take place over Whereby. Calls typically take 60-90 minutes, but we’ll block out 2 hours just in case.

On our call, we first define the current state of your video production. Then we look through your TODO list together and see what video tasks are most time consuming. Finally, we agree to a set of video tasks that would take a load off your dev-rel team’s.


## Schedule a Call To See How Many Hours You Can Save.
