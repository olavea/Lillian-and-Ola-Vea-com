Making a choice is not always easy, but it's an important life-skill for a Dev-Rel-Pirate. And like every, skill the way to get better is deliberate practice.

We watched my favourite Robin Hood movie yesterday. The Pirate Princess and me. And the way we found that movie is today's tip for a more skillful Dev-Rel-Life.

(My favourite Robin Hood movie is Disney's animated Robin Hood from 1973.)[https://twitter.com/OlaHolstVea/status/1689885143538827264/photo/1]

Five steps towards making a choice about _ _ _ _ _

1. I deleted all the movies from the wish list. (Inside Disney Plus)
2. I asked the Pirate Princess to watch trailers and add 4 movies to the wish list. (The Pirate Princess loves trailers)
3. I added 4 movies myself.
4. The Pirate Princess and I took turns saying "no" to one movie each. Until we had one movie left, Disney's animated Robin Hood from 1973.
5. We watched Robin Hood in bed.

I remember watching that Robin Hood movie in the cinema with my dad. MAN I loved that movie. I drew Robin Hood EVERY day for months in day care. And I drew that hypnist snake Hiss also. I drew Hiss with his spiralling eyes. I wish I had some of those drawings today to show The Pirate Princess.



Here are today's drawings, not even half as imbued with passion and hero worship.
