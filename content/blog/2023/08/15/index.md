«Ahoi! Lancelota is my name, but you may call me Lotta. This is Lizabeth, we've been friends since forever.» Said

«Welcome to our hood, The Bridge. It's noisy, it's crowded, but it's mostly harmless. At least so we thought.» Said

«If you're ready for a wyld ride, I'll start my story. You can stop me any time you feel dizzy, because this is going to be a totally tall tale.» Said

«A long time ago
on a Bridge far,
far away.» Said

«The river was angry that day my friends! Frothing! Frothing around the pillars of Our Bridge. A glorious morning. The sun was shining, the gulls were singing!»

«Mine! Mine!.» Most gulls sang. We got this one guileful gull on Our Bridge, Loke we call him. You can tell Loke from the other gulls by his silence. Loke is always first on new food and always silent as the Grave. I'm watching Loke now, eating something. Eating in the frothing river. Loke is a big, brave bugger. Our river can be deadly when the mood is on her, like today.

WHAT is Loke eating? Is that hair? Do I see blond hair waving in the frothing waves?

«Shiver my timbers. Maaaan overBoooaaard!» I was climbing down into the icy froth before finishing my «overBoooaaard!»

What an explosion of colors and hurl-burly Our Bridge can become in a thight spot. They hauled her out of Our River an up on Our Bridge. More than ten men and women on the rope. Singing

«What shall we do with the drunken pirate.»

She was heavy. We found a cannonball on a long rope tied to her waist.
«Albatross» we called her that morning.

What a sweet little bird she was. Beautiful. Blond. In a blue dress. But who was she? Where did she come from? WHy was she killed? It took us through many dangers to find out. But Liz and I we DID find out. We always do.

We had ONE clue now, the cannonball. The murder weapon. Some captains like to brand their cannonballs. And this cannonball had «JP» bossed on it.

So Liz and I popped by the Dodgy Dolphin for a spot of breakfast. As always there was a group of musicans and actors at the bar. We ignored them and went to the fireplace. A handful of sailors were sitting close to the roaring fire. I say «sailors», but they were pirates. We knew from a previous case.

We brought them a round of grog and ate our bacon and eggs in silence after giving them a piece of paper with my sketched «JP cannonball». It's a mistake to ask a question off of a pirate. She'll clam up. But shut up yourself and a pirate will start chatting like a magpie. Can't help herself. Silence is torture to a pirate.

A hard looking red head slammed her empty grog on the table.

«Yall heard the one about how ol'  Cap'n Croock almost lost both his hands?» She whispered huskily and pulled a big wad of chewing tobacco out of her upper gum.

I've heard several versions, but I wasn't worried, because the tales all waried.

«He wasn't old back then, Cap'n Crook. A beardless cook boy he was. We were boarding a french frigate in the Biscay. The weather turned treacherous in the wink of a lambs tail. And next thing the Captain was down in the Drink. How it happened I didn't see, but Captain Pan floating around unconcious. Helpless as a babe in a Bahamas jungle. Young Crook jumped in after. And wouldn't you know it, a shark showed up instantly. Some say Crook read about the trick in a book. The boy punched that shark right in the snout. A straight right. The shark gave Crook an insulted stare to the count of ten. Crook though didn't blink. The boy stared right back, his guard up. While the crew hoisted Captain Pan up with a yardarm. He was a wee tiny little fairy, Pan. Practically flew up and booped his little head on the yardarm. Got himself booped right back to life and MAN was he furious! Hovering like a dragonfly under the yardarm and cursing like a fishwife. Crook looked up gaping. And THAT was when crocodile slammed it's jaws shut on both of Crook's hands. Crook got the one hand unstuck, grabbed on and ripped the other arm free. His hand was gone. GONE! I'll never forget the blood. Crook swimming down there as calm as you please. His red blood blooming out of his arm in spurts. Boom! Boom! Crook climbed the bathing ladder himself. Lay down on decck with his arm aloft, blood spraying. Saying
 «Pardon me for laying down, but that swim took the wind outta my sails.»

«Look lively Billy Jukes! Patch the cook boy up. On the double. Or YOU'll need some patching up.» Roared Captain Pan down from the rigging. Captain Pan never forgot how cook boy crook saved his bacon from the shark and payed with his paw. So on his deathbed Captain Pan gave Crook the Jolly Polly.

And THAT folks is how it REALLY happened!»

We bought the pirates another round of grog and got out of there. Before dark we found out nobody had seen hair nor hide of Captain Crook or the Jolly Polly for years. And dear reader never forget to be prudent and particular with your local pirate. Buying her a few grogs will not stop her from selling you out to your enemies. More about enemies later.

Our part of town is not super safe after dark. So we went home to our beds.

«Who's this Captain Pan when he's at home?» Said Liz.

«He doesn't matter does he, as he's dead and all.»  Said I.

I was wrong on both counts as it turned out. Pan wasn't dead. Not even close. And Captain Pan mattered a LOT especially to us.

Just when we'd fallen asleep a bang woke us. «Uncle» Werlin had showed up, with five carpenters. First thing we jnow he has all our 3 windows and their window frames out of the wall. Moonlight blazing in through a boat sized hole in our bedroom wall.

«Do you young ladies have the first idea what kind of heat you've brought on? Forget about getting dressed and get aboard before you get got.» And Werlin had a boat in our bedroom.

«Easy. Easy now. Where are we going?» Said I.

«It's not a safe place is all I can tell you.»

«Sounds like we'd me crazy to go, don't it?» Said Liz.

«You can't stay.» Said Werlin.

«You watch us.» Said I

«I'll bring you in to the boss and she'll tell you what's what.» Said  Werlin

«Woah! No way.» Said Liz.

«Yes way.» Said Werlin.

«Why? What's in it for us?» Said I.

«A mission. For your sins.» Said Werlin.

«What sins?» Said Liz

«You'll know what sins soon enough. Either from your Boss or from the gauler in the Tower.» Said Werlin.

«So that's our choice huh? The Boss or the Tower. My mum stayed in the Tower. She died there.» Said Liz

«well....» Said Werlin.

«Drat that! Let's hide somewhere.» Said I.

«There's nowhere else to hide from THESE people. I should know.» Said Werlin.

«So what does that even mean? Who are they?» Said Liz.

«The right question is WHAT are THESE people able to do?. In less than five minutes they'll bombard this bridge, hoping to solve the problem you two pose the fast way.» Said Werlin.

«If we go, will that stop the bombardment?» Said Liz.

«Maybe. I'll make no promises. But if you don't go, that bombardment is guaranteed and you'll have to live with the blame. This way you at least tried.» Said Werlin.
«Okay let's go, try and stop the bombardment. What do you say Lotta?» Said Liz.

«I say somebody will pay for this. Chasing me from my OWN home. I will hurt the right somebody for this.» Said I.

«Hop aboard already.» Said Werlin.

We stepped aboard the boat.

«Knock off the lock if you please mr Pedersen.» Shouted Werlin pointing at our bedroom floorboards.

«Bang!»

«Now wait a ....» Said Liz.

«Badda-Bing!»

«Crash!»

«Swosch!»

If you've never taken a boat ride straight DOWN. Through the air. I'm afraid there's no explaining the feeling. There's nothing like your innards LIFTING off to remind you more of your body's fragility.

Darkness flashed by and then we hit the waterfall and REALLY sped up.

I've imagined the future many times before, but never like this. Never with lights all over the buildings, lights all the colors of the rainbow. We came to a gut wrenching stop in a weirdly lit blue pool. White tiles everywhere and it smelt .... clean. Brass instruments were playing an upbeat tune. A boy in a red and gold uniform looked at Werlin's ticket and pointed the way with a polite bow.

«What IS this place.» Said Liz.

«Southie. Or as they say in the future, the Southern Substructure...» Said Werlin.

«This is NOT the future?» Said I.

«No, no, no. We're still in the 1500s. But a time ship trip is doable. Maybe even probable. But NOT reccomended. Not at all.» Said .

[train station in LA]

«Good evening young ladies. I would have hoped to meet you in less dire straiths.» Said .

Liz pretended to drink.
