As we made ready to take the boat over and pick up the Pirate Princess' friend Ada, we got visitors. Little Lovis (2) and her dad Jonatan, our neighbour. I invited little Lovis in to say hello to Milly and Tilly.

## Bad News

"Yes!" Lovis said eagerly, but wouldn't come inside with just me, the smart girl. So her dad came in also, Jonatan is Queen Raae's childhood summer friend. While little Lovis was feeding Milly and Tilly pegu-treats, we got the bad news: Delays. Delays in the arrival of the Pirate Princess' classmate Ada, due to car charging chaos. Don't get me started on the sad state of Sweden's chaotic car charging infrastructure. Well, well, that's the name of the game at workation: Adversity. All you can do is
-Accept,
-Adapt and
-Get Around your newest Adversity.

So we promptly started on a splendid trio of workation projects, namely:
-Window installment
-Hauling Berglund's boat ashore
-Barbeque party at Berglund's

## Barbeque party at Berglund's With a Dry Prosecco as Starter

We started out as we always do with parties, by dressing up. Personally I put on my new blue shirt with matching shorts and new straw hat.

Queen Raae dressed in her swanky new blue sweater. And the Pirate Princess wore her favourite punk skirt. All dressed up we installed the windows Queen Raae has fixed up according to her the course she took in DIY-old-window-repair. And what a technique we three had installing those windows! Practice makes graceful!

Next up.

## Hauling Berglund's Boat Ashore

I'll just post a few photos and maybe a video.

Now the engine is empty of fuel, let's bail out the water, that's fun.

And now for the the main extra curricular project:

## Barbeque Party at Berglund's

The party started with chilled prosecco in tall glasses and hard cheese with little spicy biscuits.

With the patriarch of Berglund's I discussed our mutual satisfation with the personal attention our young ladies get from strong teachers at private and creative schools.

The grilled meat and grilled vegetables were delicious. And a powerful red wine. But the triumphant high point: dessert!
Crusty Blackberry Pie with icecreams and vanilla sauce
