I added auth today

I opened my keystone.ts file in the root of my backend project. I am going to add the auth secret sauce from keystone. Here are the steps I took.

- I created a method called `withAuth`

- With another method called `createAuth()`

- Import `createAuth` from keystone

- Inside my method an object.

- The schema responsible for being `User`

- Wrap the server `config` in `withAuth()`

I added auth today

I opened my keystone.ts file in the root of my backend project. I am going to add the auth-secret-sauce-r-üõ∏ from keystone üîë‚õ∞Ô∏è . Here are the steps I took.


- I created a method called `withAuth`

```js
const { _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ } =
```


- With another method called `createAuth()`

```js
const { withAuth } = _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ();
```


- Import `createAuth` from keystone

```js
import { _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ } from '@keystone-next/auth';

```


- Inside my method an object.

```js
const { withAuth } = createAuth( _ _ );
```


- The schema responsible for being `User`

```js
const { withAuth } = createAuth({
    listKey: _ _ _ _ ,
});
```


- Add `identityField` property with value `email`

```js
const { withAuth } = createAuth({

  identityField: ' _ _ _ _ _ ',

});
```


- Add `secretField` property with value `password`


```js
const { withAuth } = createAuth({


  secretField: ' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ',

});
```


- Add `initFirstItem` property which is an object
- Add `fields` property with an array of values `name`, `email` and `password`

```js
const { withAuth } = createAuth({



  initFirstItem: {
    fields: ['name', 'email', 'password'],
  },
});
```


- Wrap the server `config` in `withAuth()`

```js

export default  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (
    config({
        // server and stuff
    })
)
```
