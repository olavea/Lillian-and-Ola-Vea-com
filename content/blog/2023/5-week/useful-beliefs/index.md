1. Useful Beliefs can be welcomed aboard Your Dev-Skill-Builder-Ship


You Beliefs _ _ _ _ the quality of your coding and the effectivness of your Dev-Skill-Building. If you want successful Dev-Skill-Building get some Useful Beliefs. Useful Beliefs like for example "the growth mindset" can help your skill-building. Un-Useful Beliefs like "the fixed mindset" can wreck your skill-builder-ship.
Two Useful Beliefs I have welcomed aboard my dev-skill-builder-ship are:
1. "the growth mindset"
2. Dev-Skill-Builder-Ship is necessary for many devs if they are to live a worthwhile dev-life.

1. "the growth mindset"
Forget talent. or the lack of talent. Your attitude to your Dev-Skill-Building is what MATTERS. Edit your internal monologue in a mindful way. For example if a dev-task is hard to do the phrase "this is hard, I'm no good at it" will strengthen "a fixed mindset". Saying "this is hard, I'm no good at it YET" will help you strengthen "a growth mindset".

2. Dev-Skill-Builder-Ship is necessary for many devs if they are to live a worthwhile dev-life.
