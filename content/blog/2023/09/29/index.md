I am ready to go now my github account got "Maintain" access, to the repos.

- I added the “hacktoberfest” topic to our GitHub repositories to opt-in to Hacktoberfest and indicate we’re looking for contributions.
- I applied the “hacktoberfest” label to one issue we want contributors to help with on our GitHub repo

Next step is to write up the other issues we'd like help with.
