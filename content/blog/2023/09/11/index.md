ðŸ‘‘ Raae and I have started interviewing our favourite Dev-Rels. It's part of the planning of our build-in-public project MixPod.

We didn't tell the Dev-Rels, but we want to make MixPod as fun and useful as possible for Devs and Dev-Rels.

## Top Two Tips for MixPod

Good MixPod use cases should be:

- Not Opinionated + Big
- Not too related to your sponsors' products


## Opinionated + Big = Bad

Bad use cases =
Opinionated + Big

Successful use cases =
Tiny + Fun + Simple

## Have Tiny Been Fun For You?

We want to make MixPod Fun. Do you like tiny use cases? Do you remember doing a FUN tiny use case? I would love to hear about it. Please email me at ola.
