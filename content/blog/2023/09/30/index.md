Here is a draft of a Github issue for Hacktoberfest:

We are looking to make the plugin seamlessly support Cloudinary assets sourced via CMSs and other sources.

We let the user configure where to find the Cloudinary data (ie. GraphQL Type) and let the user configure where on the type to find public id, cloud name, original height, original width and mime type.

Similarly to gatsby-remote-images: [config docs link](https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-remote-images#example-config-with-optional-options)
