## I Bought a Badass Bunch of Books Sunday

While the Pirate Princess sold lemonade I bought books. They were used. They were children's books. I hope Lillian (8) will read some books by herself, but most I will read for her before bed. We need to finish the Harry Potter series first. We are reading the the forth book now.
