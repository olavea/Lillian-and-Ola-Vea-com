## I Bought a Badass Bunch of Books Sunday

While [the Pirate Princess sold lemonade](https://twitter.com/OlaHolstVea/status/1702334528570941633) I bought books. They were used. They were children's books. I hope Lillian (8) will read some books by herself, but most I will read for her before bed. We need to finish the Harry Potter series first.

## Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire

We are reading the the forth book now. Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire. It's great! It starts out pretty strong for an eight year old. It's a murder right out the gate! But that was not even close to as scary as the dementors in Harry Potter 3.
