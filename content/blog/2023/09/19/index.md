# ... In Harry Potter
I read Harry Potter 3 for the Pirate Princess last night. Lillian (8) was SCARED. She was hugging me hard on the worst parts. In fact I had to skip the parts about the Dementors. And also keep reading another chapter to calm her down after the Dementor "problem" was fixed. I read for 2 hours and 16 minutes. When Queen Raae came home she was NOT happy about the little pirate not being in bed yet. Anyway. Great writing J. K. Rowling! You are a rare pirate yourself.
