Ahoy skill-builder pirate of Jamstackia!

We looked into

in my last letter so today I'll show you my favourite focus tool find out when your sub-task practice session is done. It's my great grandfather Captain Crook's croco clock. 🐊 ⏲️ We'll look at:

What a croco-clock is,
Why it can help you focus and
How you use it.

##  WHAT is a croco-clock 🐊 ⏲️ ?

A croco-clock 🐊 is for example an egg clock ⏲️ that goes ARRR! when your sub-task practice session is done.

Then you can stop

## WHY could a croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ help you to focus like a pirate?
Firstly you decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain. This is good for your focus.

Secondly by starting your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ you confirm to yourself your decision to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain

Thirdly, the clock is literally ticking and you know you haver this ONE one practice session to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain.

## HOW do you use your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ ?
1. You set your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ to for example 96 minutes
2. And place it in another room, especially if you are using your cellphone *
3. You do your sub-task in exactly the same way again and again
4. Keep doing your sub-task again and again until your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ goes ARRR! even past the point you feel you are already doing your sub-task 96%-reliably
5. Because you're a practice pirate and this sub-task will be YOUR treasure only when you have it automated into your dev-brain

Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of GO! 😺

## Example (Warning: summer workation tall tales alert! ☀️ 🗣️ 💬 🔈 )

Write up a sentence about your croco-clock 🐊-⏲️ experiments and email it to Lillian (7 🏴‍☠️👸) and me, that would help us a lot!
