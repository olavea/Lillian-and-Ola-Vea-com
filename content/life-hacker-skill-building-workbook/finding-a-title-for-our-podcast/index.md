finding a title for our podcast

We were prepping for a podcast we were starting up for our client Xata. I decided what skill to single out for this task: Brain storming?



I set my count-down-timer to 24 minutes and I just started out writing down ideas. A lot of the names have the words "data models" in them, since the first podcast season is about data models. In the beginning I had these names:

- Doin’ Data
- Devs Doin’ Data
- Show me your data model
- Bad data model
- Data model devs





Then I asked Queen @raae about ideas

- Data models in the wild
- Data in the Wild
- Data Tales
- XataPod
-


This lead me to get some more ideas


- Dear Data
- Dear Data Model
- Data Model Hackers
- Data Tales
- Data modelers
- Dark data model
- Drunk data model
- Destructive data models

So as you see, I went back and wrote down some more ideas for a few minutes. I did this several days straight. I also made a note if I randomly got a title idea right after I woke up or in the shower. I made sure to transfer those notes to my title document that same day. This is how I build momentum with my brainstorming.


My point is, coming up with ideas takes time. But those first ideas are my job. When I have some ideas it's easier to ask people for help. For example I can ask people to help me choose among those ideas. We put out a poll on twitter:

In the first podcast season we will indie hackers we know about their own data models.
