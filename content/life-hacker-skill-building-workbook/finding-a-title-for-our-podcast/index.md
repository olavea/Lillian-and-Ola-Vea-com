Queen @raae and I were prepping for a podcast we were starting up for our client Xata. We needed a podcast title. I decided what skill to focus on for this task: Idea Collecting


## Idea Collecting Step 1: Start

I set my count-down-timer to 24 minutes and I started out writing ideas in my notebook. Most of the ideas have the word "data" in the title, since the first podcast season is about data models. In the beginning I had these three ideas:

- Doinâ€™ Data
- Devs Doinâ€™ Data
- Show me your data model


## Idea Collecting Step 2: Get Help

Then I asked Queen @raae about ideas and shared my ideas with her in a google document

- Data models in the wild
- Data in the Wild
- Data Tales
- XataPod

## Idea Collecting Step 3: More Ideas

This lead me to get some more ideas

- Dear Data
- Dear Data Model
- Data Model Hackers
- Data Model Hunters
- Data Tales
- Data modelers
- Dark data model
- Drunk data model
- Destructive data models
- Bad data model
- Data model devs


So as you see, I went back and wrote down some more ideas for a few minutes. I did this several days straight. I also made a note if I randomly got a title idea right after I woke up or in the shower. I made sure to transfer that idea to my notebook that same day. This is how I build momentum with my Idea Collecting.


## Idea Collecting Tip 1: Day After Day After Day

Coming up with ideas becomes easier for me if I take my time and spread it out over several days. My point is, coming up with those first ideas are my job. When I have some ideas it's easier to ask people for help. For example I asked people to help me choose among those ideas. We put out a poll on twitter:

That tweet got people to suggest some ideas to us

## Idea Collecting Tip 2: It's easier To Get Rid Of Ideas

So I just write down any and every idea I get

In the first podcast season we will indie hackers we know about their own data models.
