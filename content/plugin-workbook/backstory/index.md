Lance-Lotta (13) is programming on her illegal Gatsby plugin.

«What're you DOING!» Shouts Lizabeth

«I'm sourcing images from this piraty API thingy!» Says Lance-Lotta

«Sourcery! You KNOW how illegal Jamstack is under the city's new anti-witch craft laws.» Says Lizabeth

«Relax, I'll never get caught....» Says Lance-Lotta

«You'll never get caught?! Like you didn't get caught last week when you "borrowed" Merlina's yellow submarine and crashed it into our bridge? Or like that time you....» Says Lizabeth.

«Oh DO shut up or else....» Says Lance-Lotta.



«Say "or else" again and I'll make you cry.» Says Lizabeth

«Oh yeah!? We'll see who CRIES. Or else!» Says Lance-Lotta and puts Lizabeth in a headlock. The two are rolling on the floor as the door opens.

«Stop it!» A hissed whisper. «Now!» Louder, and yeah that's me, Merlina, mentor of these two reckless rascals and teller of this tall tale.

«Good don't you rascals hear the bells tolling?» Says Merlina.

«Oh no! Not another fire?» Says Lizabeth.

«No, worse. My source suspects it's one more of those peculiar pet-kidnappings.» Says Merlina.

«Your sources keep giving us useless tip after useless tip.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No useless-on-it's-own is not the same as useless.» Says Merlina.

«Really?!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«And since day ONE I've been trying to get you two to practice a useless-on-it's-own sub-task.» Says Merlina.



«Squeeck! Squaack! BEEP-bopp!» Screeches Props the parrot.

«Shut up birdy!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No wait! He's saying Mor-dred is coming!» Says Lizabeth.

«Mor-dred who?» Says Lance-Lotta.

«The Witch Hunter Mor-dred. Duh!» Says Merlina.

«So what?! When did anybody take that laughably un-funny clown Mor-dred seriously anyway?» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Queen Mary took Mor-dred seriously yesterday.» Says Merlina.

«Yeah last night Mary burned an actress at the stake.» Says Lizabeth.

«Burned based on some REAL thin "evidence" Mor-dred showed bloody Mary of Jamstackian witchcraft.» Says Merlina.

«I remember seeing Mor-Dred light his first fire, it was before he could even walk. He just couldn't take his eyes off those flames.» Says Lizabeth.

«Yeah Mor-Dred and fire, love at first sight. AND he hated you from the start. You should leave town for a few weeks. Let things settle down.» Says Lance-Lotta.



«What "things"?» Says Lizabeth.

«I SMELL it! Mor-Dred is up to NO good this time» Says Merlina.

«Where can I go anyway? No hole is deep and dark enough to be safe from my half sister Mary,» Says Lizabeth.

«I know a deep & DARK hole ....» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Sesam Sesam open up. Knock Knock it's burn o'clock!» Sings Mor-Dred.

[knock-knock](./knock-knock.png)

«Sssh! Pack yourselves and your witchy computer gear into the secret safe room. Be quiet as a mouse if Mor-Dred is in the house.» Says Merlina.

«On my count blow down this door my little piggies. Three-two-one huff puff!» Sings Mor-Dred.

«Kaa-Boom!»

[huff-puff](./huff-puff.png)

«Sunny shiny and I feel okay
'cause I'm burning Liz today
I feel okaaay todaaay
I brought computers, I brought my match
and every evidence we need to catch....» Sings Mor-Dred.

Mor-Dred lights up a pile of wood furniture and dance around the fire.

«The Liz, The Liz, The Liz is on fire. We don't need no water let the hm-hmer burn. burn hm-hmer burn!» Sings Mor-Dred.



«You think Queen Mary is using Mor-Dred to get people burned?» Says Merlina.

«Don't you? Who else is there? With that kind of clout?» Says Lizabeth.

«Well, there's always Morgause....» Says Merlina.

«Shit! No WAY! Not that witch.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Yes way» Says Merlina.
