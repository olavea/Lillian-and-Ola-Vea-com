Lance-Lotta (13) is programming on her illegal Gatsby plugin.

«What're you DOING!» Shouts Lizabeth

«I'm sourcing images from this piraty API thingy!» Says Lance-Lotta

«Sourcery! You KNOW how illegal Jamstack is under the city's new anti-witch craft laws.» Says Lizabeth

«Relax, I'll never get caught....» Says Lance-Lotta

«You'll never get caught?! Like you didn't get caught last week when you "borrowed" Merlina's yellow submarine and crashed it into our bridge? Or like that time you....» Says Lizabeth.

«Oh DO shut up or else....» Says Lance-Lotta.



«Say "or else" again and I'll make you cry.» Says Lizabeth

«Oh yeah!? We'll see who CRIES. Or else!» Says Lance-Lotta and puts Lizabeth in a headlock. The two are rolling on the floor as the door opens.

«Stop it!» A hissed whisper. «Now!» Louder, and yeah that's me, Merlina, mentor of these two reckless rascals and teller of this tall tale.

«Good don't you rascals hear the bells tolling?» Says Merlina.

«Oh no! Not another fire?» Says Lizabeth.

«No, worse. My source suspects it's one more of those peculiar pet-kidnappings.» Says Merlina.

«Your sources keep giving us useless tip after useless tip.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No useless-on-it's-own is not the same as useless.» Says Merlina.

«Really?!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«And since day ONE I've been trying to get you two to practice a useless-on-it's-own sub-task.» Says Merlina.



«Squeeck! Squaack! BEEP-bopp!» Screeches .... the parrot.

«Shut up birdy!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No wait! He's trying to say "Pinky is coming!"» Says Merlina.

«Pinky who?» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Pinky Phoenix the witch huntress. Duh!» Says Lizabeth
