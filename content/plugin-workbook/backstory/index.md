Lance-Lotta (13) is wickedly programming on her Gatsby plugin.

«What're you DOING!» Shouts Lizabeth

«I'm sourcing data from this piraty API thingy!» Says Lance-Lotta

«I'm not blind. Sourcery! You KNOW how illegal that is under the city's new anti-witch craft laws.» Says Lizabeth

«Relax, I'll never get caught....» Says Lance-Lotta

«You'll never get caught?!» Interrupts Lizabeth.

«No, I'll never get caught.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Like you didn't get caught.... » Says Lizabeth.

«Oh DO shut up or I'll make you cry.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No I'll make YOU cry. You whimp.» Says Lizabeth

«Whimp is it?!» Says Lance-Lotta and jumps on Lizabeth locking her head. The two are rolling on the flor as the door opens.

«Stop it!» A hissed whisper. «Now!» Yeah that's me, Merlina. I'm telling this tale and trying to keep these reckless young ladies outta jail.

«Hear that?» Says Merlina and in the silence they all hear bells tolling in the distance.

«Oh no! Not another fire?» Says Lizabeth

«No, worse. My source suspects it's another of those terrible kidnappings.» Says Merlina

«Your sources only gives us bites of information so tiny their useless.» Says Lizabeth.

«Yeah, a useless-on-it's-own sub-task is what you should be practicing also, then you would be able to automate it into your dev-brain.» Says Merlina.

«Squeeck! Squaack! BEEP-bopp!» Screeches .... the parrot.

«Shut up birdy!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No wait! He's trying to say "Pinky is coming!"» Says Merlina.

«Pinky who?» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Pinky Phoenix the witch huntress. Duh!» Says Lizabeth
