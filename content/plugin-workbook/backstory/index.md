Lance-Lotta (13) is programming on her illegal Gatsby plugin.

«What're you DOING!» Shouts Lizabeth

«I'm sourcing images from this piraty API thingy!» Says Lance-Lotta

«Sourcery! You KNOW how illegal Jamstack is under the city's new anti-witch craft laws.» Says Lizabeth

«Relax, I'll never get caught....» Says Lance-Lotta

«You'll never get caught?!» Interrupts Lizabeth.

«No, I'll never get caught.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Like you didn't get caught.... » Says Lizabeth.

«Oh DO shut up or I'll make you cry.» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No I'll make YOU cry. You whimp.» Says Lizabeth

«Whimp is it?!» Says Lance-Lotta and puts Lizabeth in a headlock. The two are rolling on the flor as the door opens.

«Stop it!» A hissed whisper. «Now!» Yeah that's me, Merlina. I'm telling this tale and trying to keep these reckless young ladies outta jail.

«Good don't you rascals hear the bells tolling?» Says Merlina.

«Oh no! Not another fire?» Says Lizabeth.

«No, worse. My source suspects it's one more of those peculiar pet-kidnappings.» Says Merlina

«What your sources only ever gives us is a bite of information so tiny it's useless-on-it's-own.» Says Lizabeth.

«Yeah a useless-on-it's-own sub-task is what you young rascals should be practicing.» Says Merlina.

«Squeeck! Squaack! BEEP-bopp!» Screeches .... the parrot.

«Shut up birdy!» Says Lance-Lotta.

«No wait! He's trying to say "Pinky is coming!"» Says Merlina.

«Pinky who?» Says Lance-Lotta.

«Pinky Phoenix the witch huntress. Duh!» Says Lizabeth
