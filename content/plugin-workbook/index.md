## GATSBY IMAGE CDN

### AGAIN && AGAIN!

A print-out Gatsby-plugin-workbook

- For a Gatsby-Plugin Pirate-Dev or
- For a Dev Rel at a headless CMS

Chapter 1

### Learning
### By Doing
### Through
### A Gatsby-Plugin
### Quickstart


### Before diving deep down into IMAGE CDN
Let’s talk about:
- what doing ONE dev-task again && again is like. And
- how you can automate in your dev-brain that ONE dev-task by doing it again && again. On and on.


What is it like?
Doing your dev-task again && again is a little like playing Happy Birthday on a piano until the melody sticks to your fingers.

Why do we devs so seldom do our dev-tasks again && again?

Because….

But wait! Since I am a plugin-pirate captain I can say «Let’s skip ahead to my next question!»

**What can you do to find out if a thing is actually doable?**

Or more specifically….


Will DOING a dev-ask again && again help you automate it in your dev-brain?
“The best way to find out? DOING it!”  – Captain Ola Vea senior.

## IMAGE CDN

### Gatsby-Plugin Upgrade

Your dev-task: the WHAT, the WHY and the How.

- WHAT you’re DOING is IMAGE CDN on gatsby-source-youtube-oembed. And
- WHY is faster builds.

«Nothing piraty about WHAT and WHY.» You say? Maybe not, but look at HOW....

- HOW is guessing, not coding. (Piraty, right❓ 😺 🏴‍☠️ But there's more....)

## How: You’ll only do the first third of your dev-task

- Firstly you’ll not be coding the first few times, you’ll be guessing. As I mentioned, but also.
- Secondly you’ll be guessing again && again, even if it is too easy for your dev-brain.
- Thirdly you’ll not even TRY to finish the whole IMAGE CDN upgrade on gatsby-source-youtube-oembed, you’ll only do the first third of the dev-task.

**Here you go!**

### Yo-HOW!
### Yo-HOW!
### A pirate’s life for you!

Your first sub-task:

## G. A new GraphQL _ _ _ _ _ _ type

(page shift)

### Guess her type

```js
GraphQL node type
GraphQL kraken type
GraphQL octopus type
GraphQL object type
```

![g1](./g1.jpg)


### Puzzle the shards with arrows

```js
        interfaces: [`Node`, `RemoteFile`],
        name: `....`,
        fields: {
          youTubeId: "String!",
        },
      schema
                  .buildObjectType({
```

![g2](./g2.jpg)


### Guess the name of our new type of friend

```js
TobbieThumbnailKraken
TobbieYouTubeThumbnailObject
ThumbnailTobbieOctopus
YouTubeThumbnailTobbie
```

![g3](./g3.jpg)


### Guess the "actions...." to "create" Tobbie

```js
actions.createKraken(
actions.createNode(
actions.createNodeField(
actions.createTypes(
```

![g4](./g4.jpg)


## I. Is your next sub-task:

### Inside which const do you put Tobbie's roof?

```js
const createYouTubeNode = async (gatsbyUtils, pluginOptions, youTubeId) => {
const fetchEmbed = async (id) => {
const createYouTubeThumbnailNode = (gatsbyUtils) => {
const createYouTubeTypes = (gatsbyUtils) => {
```

### Inside which _ _ - will Tobbie live?

```js
{}
[]
()
##
```

### Inside which "exports...." do we call Tobbie?

```js
exports.pluginOptionsSchema = ({ Joi }) => {
exports.createSchemaCustomization = (gatsbyUtils) => {
exports.sourceNodes = async (gatsbyUtils, pluginOptions) => {
exports.onCreateNode = (gatsbyUtils) => {
```


## M. Is your last sub-task:

### Must I `addRemoteFile........Interface(` to Tobbie?

```js
addRemoteFilePlayfillInterface(
addRemoteFilePolyfillInterface(
addRemoteFilePollyfilInterface(
addRemoteFilePiratyInterface(
```

### Must we require ….

```js
"gatsby-plugin-tools/polyfill-remote-file"
"gatsby-plugin-utils/polyfill-remote-file"
"gatsby-utils/polyfill-remote-file"
"gatsby-plugin-timeship/polyfill-remote-file"
```
## You DID it! 💪 😺 🏴‍☠️

### You've done these sub-tasks:

- G. A new GraphQL _ _ _ _ _ _ type

- I. Inside which "exports...." do we call this code?

- M. Must I `addRemoteFile........Interface(`?
