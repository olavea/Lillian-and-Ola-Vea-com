<!-- Imagine Nailing Your Skill-Building



I've been working on my dev skill-buildership since 2015 and at some point I got a sneaking suspicion that my whole life was getting better because my skill-building was improving. And wouldn't you know it! Skill-building is rewarding your brain.

AND I am not the only one feeling Like my life gets better with better skill-building. More about my fellow skill-building experimenters later, but first: how can you get started making your skill-buildership more piraty. There's not an hour to waste!


## how can you start making your skill-buildership more piraty?

There are two doors you need to unlock:
1. The piraty mindset and
2. The piraty practice

## The piraty mindset has three parts:

- Welcome Useful Beliefs aboard Your Skill-Builder-Ship
- Flow is your reward
- Mindful practice is piraty practice


## The piraty practice has four first steps:

1. Look up a dev-task you did successfully the last couple of weeks
2. Break off a useless-on-it's-own sub-task from that dev-task
3. Mak sure your sub-task is can-do-with-effort
4. Decide to automate your sub-task into your dev-brain
