Am I anxious, angry or sad? Am I tired, exhausted or sleepy? Did I bleed one drop, two drops, or three drops?

Do you also feel overwhelmed when trying to track your cycle? It's often so very detailed and clinical.

I have this mood I call #mollefonk. There is never an option for that. I never remember if I logged it as anxious or PMS...

Wouldn't it be nice to use words and terminology familiar to you?

POW! Solves this by letting you hashtag whatever cycle "thing" is important to you. It can be a made-up word like #mollefonk, or a more typical one like #pms.
