Are you anxious, angry or sad? Are you tired, exhausted or sleepy? Did you bleed one drop, two drops, or three drops?

Do you feel overwhelmed when trying to name things in your cycle? It's often so very detailed and clinical.

Our founder (@raae) has this mood she calls **#mollefonk**. There is never an option for that. So inevitably she never remembers if she logged it as anxious, PMS, angry or...you get the point.

_Wouldn't it be nice to use words and terminology familiar to you?_

**POW!** Solves this by letting you hashtag whatever cycle "thing" is important to you. It can be a made-up word like #mollefonk, or a more typical one like #pms.
