Am I often exhausted on this day in my cycle? Was it this exact day last cycle I also wanted a divorce? When should I book those sales meetings?

Knowledge is power!

I have learned not to make any drastic changes when I am #mollefonk. I tell myself if you still feel this way in two days, let's talk.

A friend cannot sell while menstruating, but on the other hand, they are a selling machine when ovulating.

POW! does not make any guesses for you, it lets you know what you have tagged before, on the same cycle day.

You might not always be able to plan around your cycle. But knowing that feeling exhausted on cycle day 14 is expected, you can at least skip the added stress of thinking there is a reason and trying to find a solution.
