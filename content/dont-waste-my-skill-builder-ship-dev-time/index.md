## Answer

Lillian (7 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏) steering                   our little boat into
town from our sea-side                      cabin.

## Your Dev-Brain Experiment                Engine Example
Look at a Dev-Task you did                  Engine
last week. Take a tiny                      handling,
part of it, set an                          a tiny
egg-clock to 96 minutes,                    part of boat-
do you tiny-task again and again.           steering for Lillian

So tiny-a-task it

## Question B1
Is my dev-task
tiny enough now?

## Answer B1                                Still too big.
No.         ->                              Probably.

## Question B2
Can you get 96%
reliable at doing
your dev-task in one
practice session?

## Answer
No. (Probably.)

But what is "reliable"?

## Question B3
Should you split
your dev-task
into a smaller
sub-task?

## Answer: Yes

< B4>
<after one practice session?>

## The Pirate Princess and her Boating-Task

## Question B4
Did Lillian (7 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏)
do her Boating-
Task 96%
reliably after one practice session?

## Answer B4
No

## The Tiny-Task Technique
Captain Ola Vea junior takes the
tiniest most useless-on-it's-own
Sub-Task. *

## The useless-on-it's-own                  Sub-Task. *
Twisting the

- To go faster backwards
- To sto the propeller

Now Lillian can use The
AGain-Technique to experiment
on her Dev-Brain.
